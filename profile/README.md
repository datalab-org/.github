This GitHub organisation collects the open source core of the *datalab* project:

- [datalab-org/datalab](https://github.com/datalab-org/datalab): the core server and web app.
- [datalab-org/datalab-api](https://github.com/datalab-org/datalab-python-api): a Python API package that can be used to interact with *datalab* instances.
- [datalab-industries/datalab-ansible-terraform](https://github.com/datalab-industries/datalab-ansible-terraform): Cloud and infrastructure automation for *datalab* instances using Terraform and Ansible.

## About

*datalab* was conceived and developed by:

- [Prof Joshua Bocarsly](https://jdbocarsly.github.io) ([Department of Chemistry, University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/chemistry), previously [Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/))
- [Dr Matthew Evans](https://ml-evs.science) ([MODL-IMCN, UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/imcn/modl) & [Matgenix](https://matgenix.com))

with contributions and testing performed by other members of the [Grey Group](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/grey/) at the University of Cambridge.

We are available for consultations on setting up and managing *datalab* deployments, as well as collaborating on or sponsoring additions of new features and techniques.
Please contact Josh or Matthew on their academic emails, visit [datalab industries](https://datalab.industries), or join the [public *datalab* Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/datalab-world/shared_invite/zt-2h58ev3pc-VV496~5je~QoT2TgFIwn4g).
