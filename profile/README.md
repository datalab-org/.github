- [Dr Matthew Evans](https://ml-evs.science) ([Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk)).

with contributions and testing performed by other members of the [Grey Group](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/grey/) at the University of Cambridge.

A full list of contributors can be found in the various GitHub repositories, for exampple [datalab-org/datalab](https://github.com/datalab-org/datalab/graphs/contributors).
